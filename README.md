 New-onset atrial fibrillation during ICU admission: A clinical prediction model

# ABSTRACT
## INTRODUCTION
New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) is a common arrhythmia in patients on an intensive care unit (ICU). NOAF in this setting is associated with adverse short and long-term outcomes. Little is known about modifiable risk factors for NOAF. Developing a model to identify patients at high risk of developing NOAF is vital for future studies investigating prevention strategies to allow stratification, sample enrichment and efficient study design.

## METHODS
We will use data from 7 general ICUs in the UK and USA to develop a predictive model for NOAF. We will assess whether including longitudinal, dynamic predictors, along with the use of machine learning approaches improves model predictive ability.

## GENERALISABILITY AND IMPLICATIONS
This work will be the largest assessment of predictors of NOAF in patients treated on a general ICU. It will be the first to analyse international data to ensure worldwide applicability. A detailed understanding of modifiable risk factors underpins future work to prevent NOAF in these patients.
 
# INTRODUCTION
# BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) is atrial fibrillation occurring in a patient with no known history of chronic or paroxysmal AF. It is the most common arrhythmia in critically ill patients. It occurs in 7-14% of all patients admitted to a general intensive care unit (ICU), rising to 23% of those patients with septic shock.
New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) is atrial fibrillation occurring in a patient with no known history of chronic or paroxysmal AF. It is the most common arrhythmia in critically ill patients. It occurs in 7-14% of all patients admitted to a general intensive care unit (ICU), rising to 23% of those patients with septic shock.
NOAF occurring during an ICU admission is associated with increased ICU and hospital mortality. There is also a significant organisational impact of NOAF as it is associated with increased length of ICU and hospital stay, and higher healthcare costs. NOAF during critical illness is also associated with longer-term complications. Patients who develop NOAF during sepsis and survive to hospital discharge have increased risks of heart failure and stroke, and poorer 1-year and 5-year survival compared those who do not develop NOAF.
The impact of NOAF highlights the importance of research into its prevention. The risk of NOAF may be increased by electrolyte abnormalities, the use of central venous catheters or other avoidable conditions or treatments, however these require further study. Our systematic review did not show a strong evidence base for modifiable factors due to inadequate studies. There are therefore no evidence-based preventative interventions.
Existing studies of NOAF risk factors often use data collected at ICU admission for prediction, but not data collected during a patient’s stay. The variation in when NOAF occurs during a patient’s ICU stay makes the analysis of time-varying covariates important. Analysis of large in-ICU databases will allow detailed exploration of avoidable risk factors accounting for changes in vital signs, laboratory results, and other markers of illness severity.
Identifying modifiable risk factors for NOAF will allow clinicians to develop interventions that might prevent NOAF in ICU patients and test them in randomised controlled studies. Given the likely morbidity and mortality associated with NOAF this could greatly improve the outcomes of a vulnerable patient group.
Developing a tool to identify patients at high risk of developing NOAF is vital for future studies investigating prevention strategies to allow stratification, sample enrichment and efficient study design.
